# Monte Carlo Methods

> Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class
> of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to
> obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness
> to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

# Monte Carlo Approximation of Pi

<table>

<td style="padding: 0; width: 30vw">
- Throw balls in a $2\times2$ box.
- Count the fraction of balls that fall into *unit circle*.
- $\operatorname{P}(X^2 + Y^2 < 1) = \pi / 4.$

# A Little Theory

Instead of

$$E[f] = \int f(x) p(x) \mbox{d} x,$$

we calculate

$$\hat \mu_f = \frac 1 N \sum_i f(x_i),$$

with the $x_i$ distributed according to $p(x)$, i.e. $\mathcal{U}(-1,
1) \times \mathcal{U}(-1, 1)$ in our example.

# One More Example

## A/B Testing

<table>
<tr>
<th>Variant <th> Impressions <th> Clicked <th> Conv. rate
<tr>
<td>A <td> 1000<td> 22 <td> 2.2 %
<tr>
<td>B <td> 1200<td> 36 <td> 3.0 %
</table>

But is it *significant*? What about **confidence intervals**?

# Math Warning!

Hit rate $r$, $N$ impressions, $k$ hits.

$$\newcommand{P}{\operatorname{P}}\begin{eqnarray}
\P(r | \mbox{data}) &\propto& \P(\mbox{data} | r) \P(r) 
\propto r^k (1 - r)^{N-k} \mathcal{U}(0, 1)\\
&\propto& \operatorname{Beta}(k + 1, N - k + 1)
\end{eqnarray}$$

# Why Do Monte Carlo on Spark?

- Spark is usually used to *process* large data quantities. We use it
  to **produce** data.
- Sometimes we need to repeat a simulation many times, scanning a
  *parameter space*.
    - Easy to parallelize.
- Spark provides.
    - Easy to use framework.
    - Reliability.
    - Availability.

# Modeling Traffic

# The Nagel-Schreckenberg Model


- Road with $N$ spots, $k$ occupied by cars.
- Discrete simulation time steps $t \rightarrow$ discrete speeds.
- Speed limit $v_{max}$ units.
- Simple rules:
    1) If going slower than $v_{max}$, accelerate by 1 unit.
    2) If getting too close to the car in front, decelerate by enough
        units to avoid a crash.
    3) With a given probability $p$, reduce the speed by 1 unit.
