# Forecasting At Scale: Monte Carlo Simulations With Apache Spark

Monte Carlo simulations are a truly multi-purpose tool that lately get
a lot of attention from the data science community. They are used in
applications ranging from pricing of financial instruments to material
sciences. We will introduce some basic concepts by example without
getting lost in details. Using Apache Spark, we will demonstrate how
one can use off-the-shelf technologies to estimate potentially complex
properties of systems using Monte Carlo simulations at scale. We will
use this application to do some live coding with a basic introduction
to Spark and its capabilities.
